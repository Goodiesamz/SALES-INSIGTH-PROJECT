  ### Data cleaning/Preparation

  In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the folowing tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspections
  2. Handing missing values and duplicates
  3. Data cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

 1 Calculate
 
 - Gross Sales
 - Discount (use the discount rate)
 - Revenue
   
 2 Compare 2013 Q4 and 2014 Q4 figures to highlight
year on year results.
 - What is the oerall sales trend?
 - what are the peak sales periods?

### Results/Findings

1. Overall Sales Performance :
Total Gross sales for the company has steadily increased over the past year. 

2. Profitability: Total profits reached 121.22 million.

3. Top-Performing Models :
The top-selling product models are ( Model A (Biro) with a revenue of 33.8 million, Model B (Note pad) with a revenue  of 21 million and other products with an average performance.

4. Trends and Patterns: There's a seasonal fluctuations in sales or shifts in consumer Preferences. Although Biro has remained the most sorted products, There's been a change in product behaviourial pattern between 2013 Q3 and 2014 Q4.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

1. Focus on High-Performing Models:  Invest in marketing and production for models that generate the most sales and profits.

2. Address Underperformance: Analyze and develop strategies for models that are underperforming in terms of sales and profitability.

3. Enhance Customer Engagement: Implement targeted marketing campaigns   based on consumer preferences and buying behavior.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis, Also had to change some columns type from text to the appropriate type each functions required.
